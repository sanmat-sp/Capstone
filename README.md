# Capstone - Image Watermarking and Authentication using Biometrics
* Approch is based on DWT-DCT-SVD for embedding, HVS for selecting the best block to embed and PSO for improving the watermarked image's quality.
* Both Blind and Non-blind watermarking methods implemented.
* Create a database to store the image id, image, LL band (In case of non-blind method) and best block's number.
* Tested with different type of image processing attacks.
